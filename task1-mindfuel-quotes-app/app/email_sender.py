    the motivational quote and author in the message body.

    Args:
        to_email (str): Recipient's email address.
        name (str): Recipient's first name or full name (used for greeting). 
            If empty or None, defaults to a generic "Hello" greeting.

def send_email_with_retries(user, quote):
    """
    Send a motivational email to a user with retry logic and exponential backoff.

    This function attempts to send an email containing a motivational quote to a user.
    It automatically retries delivery for transient failures (e.g., network or SMTP connection errors)
    using exponential backoff. Permanent failures such as authentication errors or
    invalid recipients stop retries immediately.

    After all attempts (successful or failed), the function logs the final outcome
    in the database via `db.log_email()`.

    Args:
        user (dict): A dictionary representing the user record, containing:
            {
                "id": int,           # User ID in the database
                "email": str,        # Recipient email address
                "name": str | None   # User’s name (optional)
            }
        quote (dict): A dictionary containing the quote text and author, e.g.:
            {
                "quote": "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you at the perfect time.",
                "author": "Unknown"
            }

    Returns:
        bool: 
            - True if the email was sent successfully.
            - False if all retry attempts failed.

    Raises:
        None directly. All exceptions are caught, logged, and retried as appropriate.

    Logging:
        - INFO: When starting to send, on success, and final result.
        - DEBUG: For each individual send attempt.
        - WARNING: When retrying after a failed attempt.
        - ERROR: On failures or SMTP errors.
        - Database logging (via `db.log_email`) records the final status.

    Notes:
        - Retries use **exponential backoff**: each subsequent delay doubles 
          based on `EMAIL_RETRY_BASE_SECONDS`.
        - The number of maximum retries is controlled by `EMAIL_MAX_RETRIES`.
        - Fatal errors (e.g., invalid credentials or recipient rejection) stop
          the retry cycle immediately.
